About Me
--------

I am Chris, a 20-odd year old ICT masters student from Sweden with a particular interest in fault-tolerant and/or distributed systems. I also enjoy photography, mathematics, natural languages, typography, design in general, procrastinating, learning things, nature, tea and cats. I like to consider myself a libertarian, upon further inspection however, you'll find that I'm a mess of mixed ideologies. But that is neither here nor there.

I've been programming since elementary school and sometimes it feels like I have been experimenting with every programming technique known to man by now. Of course, I haven't. I haven't even been close. It is true, though, that I have a problem with trying *everything* I can get my hands on.

I also have a problem with finishing things. I would really love to point to somewhere and say, "Look, I made that," but I can not. People tell me I do have a knack for both teaching and writing though, so I hope that will be good for this project.


About the Book
--------------

The things that make this book unique are

 *  That it is **completely open**,
 *  That it uses **Haskell** as the teaching language, and
 *  That it is aimed at experienced computer users with **no prior programming knowledge**.

There are many books on programming out there. There are even many books on beginning programming. There is *not a single book* on beginning Haskell programming. The closest you will get is the bible called <abbr>sicp</abbr>, Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs, but it is very academic in nature, and Haskell didn't even exist when it was written.

I want to provide an accessible (but hard!) introduction to computer programming presented from a functional perspective. I say hard because I believe programming is inherently hard. You must have the motivation to go through with it, and I will not produce any half-measured explanations. I will either explain things properly or not at all. At times, you will be frustrated because I glance over things without explaining them; you'll have to trust me that the explanation would just make it worse at that time.

At first, I was writing this book in [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). I was intent on getting it published proper, on dead trees and all. After a while I realised that it will probably reach more people if I just put it "out there." So I decided to go the opposite route -- I decided to make it completely open and release the source for it on [GitHub](https://github.com/), the collaboration tool by programmers for programmers.

The book is far from complete, but I will be continuously improving on it and adding to it. My first priority is to get the first few (already written) chapters up to desired shape. As I proof-read when converting the LaTeX to [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) I noticed a few things that would be better off getting fixed.

Although I am the primary author of this book, I welcome all community support. There are links in the footer to access the source for the book and for reporting errors in the manuscript. If you are a developer, you are naturally free to fork me on GitHub.

The name of the book was initially just "hsp" because I love random letter combinations, but I continued to accidentally subvocalise it as "hasp" so that's what it became. If you need order in your life, you can pretend it stands for HASkell Programming. But really, it doesn't. It doesn't mean anything.
