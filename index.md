Hello!

Whoever you are, you have arrived at my attempt to create an **open introductory book to programming**, aimed at people who are experienced with computers but have little to no programming knowledge. This book is unique in a few aspects, and therefore, you will not find a book like this one anywhere else.

If you want to get started right away, [the first chapter is this way](/2012/11/17/part-1-introduction). If you want to know what you're getting into, you could always check out the funky reverse [table of contents](/contents.html).

If you have no idea who I am and why I'm doing this, read [about me and this book](/about.html).
