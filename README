Hello!
======

Whoever you are, you have arrived at my attempt to create an **open introductory book to programming**, aimed at people who are experienced with computers but have little to no programming knowledge. This book is unique in a few aspects, and therefore, you will not find a book like this one anywhere else.

You should read the book at [http://hasp.xkqr.org/](http://hasp.xkqr.org/).
